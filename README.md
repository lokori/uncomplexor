# uncomplexor

Experimental Leiningen plugin to measure complexity of Clojure code.

## Usage

FIXME: Use this for user-level plugins:

Put `[uncomplexor "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your
`:user` profile, or if you are on Leiningen 1.x do `lein plugin install
uncomplexor 0.1.0-SNAPSHOT`.

FIXME: Use this for project-level plugins:

Put `[uncomplexor "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your project.clj.

FIXME: and add an example usage that actually makes sense:

    $ lein uncomplexor
